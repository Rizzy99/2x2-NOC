# 2x2-NOC
Implemented the VLSI design flow for an advanced 2x2 Network on Chip , progressing from RTL to GDS using Cadence and Synopsys tools. Tasks include RTL simulation, code coverage,
synthesis, STA, DFT with scan insertion, and layout steps such as floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and power
analysis, achieving final GDS generation.
